## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document lays out a project plan for the development of “Smart Cookie," a project by Rajual Z. 

The intended readers of this document are mentors and future employers. The plan will include, but is not restricted to, a summary of the system functionality, the scope of the project from the perspective of the “Smart-Cookie” team (me and my mentors), scheduling and delivery estimates, project risks and how those risks will be mitigated, the process by which I will develop the project, and metrics and measurements that will be recorded throughout the project.

## 2.0 Overview

Tired of looking in the fridge thinking there is nothing to eat? Smart Cookie aims to be more resourceful and not wasteful by finding recipes you can prepare with ingredients you already have at home! No more last minute grocery shopping and bad spending habits from going to the grocery store while hungry.

### 2.1 Customers

Everyone. Anyone can use this application ranging from a child to an old-age person.

### 2.2 Functionality

    Users should be able to register through their already existing accounts.
    They should be able to enter there food in the fridge.
    They should be able to choose from a list of recipes to cook.
    
### 2.3 Platform

This will be a Web-based application and possible iOS application in the future.

### 2.4 Development Responsibility

I, Rajual Z, would be developing the software with guidance of my mentors and I am responsible for the creation of the Database and all the other related stuffs.

## 3.0 Goals and Scopes

    Users should be able to register through their already existing accounts.
    They should be able to enter there food in the fridge.

    They should be able to take photographs to share.
    They should be able to save recipes.
    
## 4.0 Deliverables

I’ll deliver the following during the course of development:

    Feature specification
    Product design
    Test plan
    Development document
    Source code

## 5.0 Risk Management 

### 5.1 Risk Identification 

1) There are better sources out there for this and the possibility recipes will not be drawn from the API.

### 5.2 Risk Mitigation

Even though there is a possibility recipes will not be found there could be
  1) Add recipe option
  2) Function to find recipes that may need one or two more ingredients
